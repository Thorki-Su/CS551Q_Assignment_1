### What is this?
This `README.md` file (version 1.0) shows some problems I met in the process of doing this Assignment. Hope this will help you.

### Get python version 3.10.7
When open your codio link for this Assignment, firstly checking the python version is necessary. Try with this code:
```bash 
    python --version
```
If your python version is 2.7.17, you should download 3.10.7 version. Type the following command:
```bash
    pyenv install 3.10.7
```
If you meet an error like '*python-build: definition not found: 3.10.7*', then you should upload your pyenv. Try this:
```bash
    cd ~/.pyenv
    git pull
```
Then, go back to your working directory:
```bash
    cd -
```
Now you should be able to download the version 3.10.7:
```bash
    pyenv install 3.10.7
```
After downloading, remember to check the version again. If it's still 2.7.17, try this command:
```bash
    pyenv rehash
```

### Download files from github repository
I have created a repository on github for this Assignment, you can download files from it.
Firstly, make sure you've received my invitation and selected consent. Only if you do this will you have the permission to follow up.
Then, you can use this commend to 
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thorki-Su/CS551Q_Assignment_1.git
```
This will download all the files into your codio as a new folder '*CS551Q_Assignment_1*'.
Remember to change your path before do any testings or changes:
```bash
    cd CS551Q_Assignment_1
```
