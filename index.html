      <P1>
CO₂ Emission Accounting Software is designed to track, analyze, and report carbon emissions for countries categorized by income levels (low, medium, high) across different continents. The system ensures accurate emissions recording, visualization, and analysis to support climate action strategies.
This application is modular  scalable, and user-centric, catering to the specific needs of Administrators, Researchers, Policy Makers, and Guests while ensuring future extensibility. Each user role is designed to optimize data accessibility, decision-making, and collaboration.</P1>
The CO₂ Emission Accounting Software provides robust functionalities for data management, categorization, and trend analysis, ensuring accurate tracking and insightful reporting of emissions across different economic and geographical classifications.

  <h1>Data Management and Emission Tracking</h1>
  <p1>This module systematically processes, stores, and updates emission records for different countries, ensuring data accuracy and accessibility. It supports structured reporting and analytics for policymakers, researchers, and environmental organizations.
Income-Based Categorization
Emissions data is segregated by income groups, enabling comparative insights between economies at different development stages. This classification helps identify patterns, disparities, and areas for targeted climate action across:
•	Low-Income Countries – Emerging economies with limited industrial emissions.
•	Middle-Income Countries – Developing nations with moderate carbon footprints.
•	High-Income Countries – Industrialized nations contributing significantly to global emissions.
Regional Classification
The system organizes emissions data by continent, allowing users to assess trends within and across geographic regions. This feature helps track regional emission patterns, compare climate policies, and monitor continental progress toward carbon neutrality (e.g., Africa, Asia, and Europe).
Time-Based Analysis
This functionality calculates and compares annual emission trends, facilitating historical analysis and progress tracking. Users can assess reduction efforts, policy effectiveness, and emerging trends over time. For example, comparing emissions from 2020 to 2021:
•	Africa: 2020 (9.13456), 2021 (7.28930) → ↓20.2% reduction
•	Asia: 2020 (8.28393), 2021 (8.93022) → ↑7.8% increase
•	Europe: 2020 (7.83972), 2021 (6.03922) → ↓23.0% reduction
These insights provide data-driven evidence for climate strategies and highlight regional successes and areas requiring stronger policy interventions.</p2>
